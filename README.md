# Advanced Shaders
This work was completed during the second half of my final year, we were tasked with creating a landscape using a simple C++ OpenGL Renderer that was given to us. I built the terrain using a height map and applied a shader to colour the terrain based on the height map's values and the normal of the vertices. I created the water in a similar way, but translated the height map over time to create the impression of waves. There are also basic shadows in this project using framebuffers and shadow mapping

# Terrain and Water Made Using Displacement Map, Both the Terrain and Water Have Tessellation Applied
